# LEARNING TYPESCRIPT
This repo was birthed during the course of me learning Typescript and contain examples and comments that I penned down during the learning process.

 The repo had three folders 
 - ```learningTypescript```( it further contains subfolders that divides Typescript into different concepts ), 
 - ```primer1```( contains javascript concept important for learning Typescript ) and 
 - ```primer2```( contains javascript concept that makes learning Typescript a breeze ).
